## Style and artwork
  - We've used the modular Sci-Fi Kitbash Level Builder: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/scifi-kitbash-level-builder
  - We've used the original Doom's sound FX, GDC 2018 & 2019 audio packs and some Infinity Blade Effects (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbPHuU1KRs)
  - Player can be controlled with keyboard and mouse and we added the controller input.
  - We've tryed to mimic some Doom saga tipical mechanics (Shooting targets and enemies, gates, canons, keys...)
  - Research we've made: UI, Sounds, AI, animation (the NPC is made with a custom animation), triger area.
